Instruction

This Brick-Break game is designed for users to kill time or have fun. There are several steps to use it. 

Firstly, when users enter the login page, they should press the register button and fill out the form, including the account, password, email and gender. That basic information can be saved by Save.java. After that, users can log in using the account and password registered before. If the validation passes, it comes to the menu page. Otherwise, it'll prompt validation failure and the users should log in again until passing or exiting this system. 

The menu page has three functions which are New Game, Help and Quit. Choosing Help, a new page will pop out to show how to play this game. Choosing Quit means exiting this game. Choosing New Game, the game will start. 

By just clicking the mouse, the system will use a ball to break bricks. If it hits bricks, they will disappear and users win scores. One brick equals one score. The ball will drop down then and it can be served again by using the paddle on the ground. The paddle is controlled by users to move left and right with the keyboard. Meanwhile, the system can monitor and show the ball's path, whether it hits a brick, a paddle, or a corner. For this game, it will end either because the ball isn't caught by the paddle or all bricks are broken.

Finally, if bricks arenâ€™t eliminated, users lose the game and they can try again or exit. If all bricks are eliminated, users win the game and they can choose to level up the game or exit. The game can be leveled up two times. It ends after all passing.
